    The default parameterisation reads the head's outputs as knot values of a

    Here the outputs are read as *increments* instead. softplus sends every one
    of them to a positive number, the cumulative sum is therefore strictly
    increasing, and normalising by the final value pins the curve to [0, 1].
    The mapping cannot invert, whatever the network emits, while the implied
    scaling factor stays free to rise or fall - so an edit that lifts shadows
    and rolls off highlights is still expressible.
