"""Record the curves the network predicts, as training proceeds.

The curve layer predicts knot vectors, and what those knots look like over a run
is the question the layer exists to answer. Nothing in the training loop records
them, so this does: run a fixed image through the network, capture the output of
each curve head with a forward hook, and append a row to a JSON Lines file.

One fixed image throughout, so successive rows differ because the network
changed and not because the input did.
